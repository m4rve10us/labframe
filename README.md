Building tools that bridge molecular biology and machine intelligence.

Initial direction:
- Biochemically-informed LLM tools
- ML-assisted protein function prediction
- Simulation environments for metabolic networks

This repo is for prototypes that make computational biology more intuitive, scalable, and automated.

Long-term: I want to be a builder at the frontier of AI-native science.
